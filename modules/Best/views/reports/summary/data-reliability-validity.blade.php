A collective observation from multiple individuals is critical to ensure that a better understanding of an organisation is achieved. Hence, a minimum sample size of 5 to 10% of the total organisation staff strength is RECOMMENDED to complete the series of questionnaire to ensure the reliability of the report is not compromised.')</p>
